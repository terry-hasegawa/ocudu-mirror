/// \brief This class manages PUCCH resource collisions within a cell.
///
/// It keeps track of the usage of both common and dedicated resources for each slot, and provides methods to allocate
/// and free resources while accounting for collisions with other resources or other UL grants. Each operation updates
/// the provided UL resource grid accordingly.
///
/// PUCCH-to-UL grant collisions are handled via the UL resource grid, while PUCCH-to-PUCCH collisions are handled by
/// precomputing which resources collide with each other, taking into account the multiplexing capabilities of PUCCH.
///
/// \remark To deal with the multiplexing capabilities of some PUCCH formats, we define the following concepts:
/// - Multiplexing index. A number that identifies the orthogonal sequence used by a PUCCH resource. Computed from:
///   - Format 0: initial cyclic shift.
///   - Format 1: initial cyclic shift and time domain OCC index.
///   - Format 2/3: not multiplexed (always 0).
///   - Format 4: OCC index.
/// - Multiplexing region. A set of PUCCH resources that overlap in time and frequency but can be allocated together:
///   - They share the same time-frequency allocation.
///   - They share the same PUCCH format.
///   - They have different multiplexing indices.
